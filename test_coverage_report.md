- **`plexus/ScorecardResultsAnalysis.py`** - 8% (314/342 missed)  
- **`plexus/analysis/topics/transformer.py`** - 6% (708/752 missed)
- **Multiple CLI command modules** - 0% (unused in current test suite)

### **⚡ Core Infrastructure Coverage**
- **Dashboard API Models:** 60-90% (well tested)
- **Scores/Nodes:** 50-90% (good coverage)  
- **CLI Components:** 0-30% (minimal coverage)
- **Analysis Tools:** 5-15% (very low coverage)

## **Test Infrastructure Status**

### **✅ Now Working Perfectly**
- **All dependencies installed successfully**
- **367 tests passing** across 52 test files
- **Coverage reporting working** with HTML and terminal output
- **CI/CD ready** - tests can be automated

### **� Test Environment Details**
```bash
# Working setup:
pyenv local 3.11.13
python -m venv plexus_env
source plexus_env/bin/activate  
pip install -e .
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html -v
```

## **Priority Action Items**

### **🔴 URGENT: MCP Server Testing (10% → 80%+)**
**Impact:** Critical infrastructure with no functional testing

**Immediate Tasks:**
1. **Add tests for all MCP tool functions:**
   - `think()` - AI reasoning tool
   - `list_plexus_scorecards()` - Scorecard discovery  
   - `run_plexus_evaluation()` - Core evaluation functionality
   - `get_evaluation_results()` - Results retrieval
   - 12+ other MCP tools

2. **Add integration tests:**
   - Mock Dashboard API responses
   - Test authentication flows
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Async operation testing

3. **Add end-to-end tests:**
   - Full MCP server workflows
   - Multi-tool interactions
   - Performance testing

### **🟡 MEDIUM: Core Analysis Tools (5-15% → 60%+)**
- `plexus/analysis/topics/` modules need comprehensive testing
- `plexus/Evaluation.py` core functionality testing
- `plexus/ScorecardResultsAnalysis.py` analysis workflows

### **🟢 LOW: CLI Coverage (0-30% → 50%+)**
- Many CLI modules have zero coverage but may not need full testing
- Focus on core CLI workflows that are actually used
- Command integration testing

## **Testing Quick Wins Available Right Now**

### **✅ Ready to Implement Today**
```bash
# MCP Server - can immediately add tests for:
cd MCP
# Test each individual MCP tool function with mocked responses
# Test authentication and authorization
# Test error handling and edge cases
```

### **📋 Recommended Test Additions**
1. **MCP Integration Tests** - Test tool interactions with mock Dashboard
2. **Error Scenario Testing** - Network failures, auth errors, malformed requests  
3. **Performance Testing** - Response times, concurrent requests
4. **End-to-End Workflows** - Complete user journeys through MCP interface

## **Success Metrics & Goals**

### **Short-term (Next Sprint)**
- **MCP Server coverage:** 10% → 60%
- **Add 50+ new tests** for MCP functionality
- **Set up automated CI/CD** with coverage reporting

### **Medium-term (Next Quarter)**  
- **Overall project coverage:** 30% → 60%
- **Core analysis tools coverage:** 15% → 50%
- **Documentation coverage** in critical modules

### **Long-term (Ongoing)**
- **Maintain 80%+ coverage** for new code
- **Regular coverage monitoring** in CI/CD
- **Performance regression testing**

## **Infrastructure Status: ✅ WORKING**

The testing infrastructure is now **fully functional** and ready for immediate use:

- ✅ **Python 3.11 environment working**
- ✅ **All dependencies installed successfully** 
- ✅ **367 tests passing reliably**
- ✅ **Coverage reporting with HTML output**
- ✅ **Ready for CI/CD integration**

The MCP server coverage gap is now the **primary blocker** that needs immediate attention.
