# Plexus Test Coverage Report

**Date:** June 15, 2025  
**Analysis:** Comprehensive test coverage assessment for the Plexus project

## Executive Summary

The Plexus project has **severely inadequate test coverage**, particularly for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server component. The analysis reveals critical gaps in testing infrastructure and coverage that pose significant risks to code quality and maintainability.

## Key Findings

### 1. MCP Server Coverage: **CRITICAL - 9% Coverage**

- **File:** `MCP/plexus_fastmcp_server.py`
- **Total Statements:** 1,330
- **Missed Statements:** 1,208
- **Coverage:** **9%** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Test File:** `MCP/plexus_fastmcp_server_test.py` (89 lines)

#### What's Being Tested (9% coverage):
- URL utility functions only:
  - `get_plexus_url()` - URL construction with various path formats
  - `get_report_url()` - Report URL generation
  - `get_item_url()` - Item URL generation
  - Basic URL handling edge cases (trailing slashes, localhost)

#### What's NOT Being Tested (91% missing):
- **All 15+ MCP tool functions** including:
  - `think()` - Core reasoning tool
  - `list_plexus_scorecards()` - Scorecard listing
  - `run_plexus_evaluation()` - Evaluation dispatch
  - `get_plexus_scorecard_info()` - Scorecard details
  - `get_plexus_score_details()` - Score configuration
  - `find_plexus_score()` - Score search
  - `get_plexus_score_configuration()` - Config retrieval
  - `pull_plexus_score_configuration()` - Config downloading
  - `push_plexus_score_configuration()` - Config uploading
  - `update_plexus_score_configuration()` - Config updates
  - All reporting tools
  - All item and task management tools
  - Documentation access tools

- **Critical Infrastructure:**
  - FastMCP server initialization
  - Authentication handling
  - Error handling and logging
  - Dashboard client integration
  - Account resolution and caching
  - Environment variable processing
  - GraphQL query execution
  - Async operation handling

### 2. Overall Project Test Infrastructure: **BROKEN**

Attempted to run full project tests but encountered **52 import errors** due to missing dependencies:

#### Missing Core Dependencies:
- `yaml` - YAML processing (required by core Evaluation module)
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- Many other packages from `pyproject.toml`

#### Test Files Present But Failing:
- **49 test files** found across the project
- **Zero tests successfully running** due to dependency issues
- Test files exist in multiple areas but infrastructure is broken

## Detailed Analysis

### MCP Server Testing Status

The MCP server is a critical component with **3,280 lines of code** but only **trivial URL utility functions are tested**. This represents a massive gap in quality assurance for:

1. **Business Logic:** No tests for core MCP tool functionality
2. **Integration:** No tests for dashboard API integration  
3. **Error Handling:** No tests for failure scenarios
4. **Authentication:** No tests for security components
5. **Performance:** No tests for async operations
6. **Data Validation:** No tests for input/output validation

### Test Environment Issues

1. **Dependency Management:** Project dependencies not properly installed
2. **Environment Setup:** No clear testing environment setup
3. **CI/CD:** Testing infrastructure appears unmaintained
4. **Documentation:** No testing documentation found

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Dependency Issues**
   - Install missing dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
   - Set up proper virtual environment
   - Ensure all test files can import successfully

2. **MCP Server Test Coverage**
   - **Target: 80%+ coverage** for MCP server
   - Add unit tests for all 15+ MCP tool functions
   - Add integration tests for dashboard API calls
   - Add error handling tests
   - Add authentication tests

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

3. **Core Module Testing**
   - Fix imports for core Plexus modules
   - Enable existing test files to run
   - Establish baseline coverage metrics

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
   - Add coverage reporting to build process
   - Create testing documentation

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Target 90%+ coverage for critical components
   - Add performance and load testing
   - Add security testing
   - Add integration testing with external services

## Files Generated

- **HTML Coverage Report:** `MCP/htmlcov/index.html`
- **Detailed Coverage:** `MCP/htmlcov/plexus_fastmcp_server_py.html`

## Testing Commands Used

```bash
# MCP Server Testing
cd MCP
python -m pytest plexus_fastmcp_server_test.py -v --cov=plexus_fastmcp_server --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Results: 10 tests passed, 9% coverage
```

## Impact Assessment

**Risk Level: HIGH** üî¥

The extremely low test coverage, especially for the MCP server (9%), represents a significant risk to:
- Code quality and reliability
- Feature development velocity  
- Production stability
- Maintenance burden
- Developer confidence

**Immediate investment in testing infrastructure and coverage is strongly recommended.**
