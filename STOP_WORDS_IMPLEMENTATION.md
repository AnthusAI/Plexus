# Stop Words Filtering Implementation

## Overview

Added configurable stop words filtering to the BERTopic topic modeling pipeline. This allows users to remove common English stop words (like "to", "the", "called") from topic keywords, resulting in more meaningful topic representations.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **plexus/analysis/topics/analyzer.py**
   - Added three new parameters to `analyze_topics()` function:
     - `remove_stop_words` (bool, default: False)
     - `custom_stop_words` (Optional[List[str]], default: None)
     - `min_df` (int, default: 1)
   - Added import for `CountVectorizer` and `ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS` from sklearn
   - Added logic to create custom CountVectorizer when stop words filtering is enabled
   - Modified BERTopic initialization to use custom vectorizer

2. **plexus/reports/blocks/topic_analysis.py**
   - Extracted stop words configuration from YAML config
   - Added configuration logging for stop words settings
   - Passed stop words parameters to `analyze_topics()` function

3. **test_stop_words_config.yaml** (new file)
   - Example configuration demonstrating stop words filtering

4. **test_stop_words.py** (new file)
   - Unit test to verify stop words filtering works correctly

## Configuration

### YAML Configuration Format

```yaml
bertopic_analysis:
  min_ngram: 1
  max_ngram: 2
  min_topic_size: 10
  top_n_words: 10
  
  # Stop words filtering (new parameters)
  remove_stop_words: true  # Enable English stop words filtering
  custom_stop_words: ["called", "call", "customer", "agent"]  # Add custom stop words
  min_df: 2  # Ignore terms appearing in fewer than 2 documents
```

### Parameters

- **remove_stop_words** (bool, default: false)
  - Enables filtering of common English stop words
  - Uses sklearn's built-in ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS set (318 words)
  
- **custom_stop_words** (list of strings, optional)
  - Additional domain-specific stop words to filter
  - Combined with English stop words when `remove_stop_words: true`
  
- **min_df** (int, default: 1)
  - Minimum document frequency for terms
  - Terms appearing in fewer than `min_df` documents are ignored
  - Useful for filtering rare/noisy terms

## Testing

### Unit Test Results

The implementation was tested with a simple unit test (`test_stop_words.py`):

```
âœ… All tests passed successfully!

Key findings:
- 318 English stop words loaded from sklearn
- Custom stop words successfully added
- CountVectorizer created with 321 total stop words
- Stop words successfully filtered from vocabulary
- No stop words found in final vocabulary
```

### Example Output

**Before stop words filtering:**
- Topic keywords might include: "to", "the", "called", "call", "customer", "agent", "ask", "order"

**After stop words filtering:**
- Topic keywords only include: "ask", "order", "billing", "questions", "helped", "issue", "check", "status"

## Usage Example

### For the Sanmar Client Report

To enable stop words filtering in the existing Sanmar report configuration:

```yaml
bertopic_analysis:
  skip_analysis: false
  num_topics: 10
  min_topic_size: 8
  top_n_words: 6
  
  # Add these new lines:
  remove_stop_words: true
  custom_stop_words: ["called", "call", "customer", "agent", "sanmar"]
  min_df: 2
```

This will:
1. Remove all common English stop words (318 words)
2. Remove domain-specific words: "called", "call", "customer", "agent", "sanmar"
3. Ignore terms that appear in fewer than 2 documents

## Benefits

1. **More Meaningful Topics**: Topic keywords focus on actual content rather than common words
2. **Better Topic Distinction**: Removes generic words that appear across all topics
3. **Improved Interpretability**: Easier to understand what each topic is about
4. **Customizable**: Can add domain-specific stop words for any industry

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Default value for `remove_stop_words` is `false`
- Existing configurations will work unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing reports

## Next Steps

To use this feature for the client:

1. Update the Sanmar report configuration to enable stop words filtering
2. Run the report with a small sample to verify results
3. Adjust `custom_stop_words` list based on observed keywords
4. Run full report with optimized configuration

## Technical Notes

- Uses sklearn's `CountVectorizer` with custom stop words list
- Stop words are combined (English + custom) before vectorization
- Compatible with all existing BERTopic features (representation models, topic reduction, etc.)
- No performance impact when disabled (default behavior)
