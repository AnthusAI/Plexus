    """Test graceful degradation when checkpointing fails"""
```

### **7. Batch Processing (MEDIUM - But Critical for Scale)**
**Issue:** 3 tests skipped, batch processing untested

**Missing Coverage:**

## üö® **Most Critical Tests to Implement First**

### **Priority 1 (This Week):**
1. **Fix existing skipped tests** - Update them for current implementation
2. **Test routing enhancements** - Protect recent critical changes  
3. **Test core prediction workflow** - Ensure basic functionality works
4. **Test state management** - Core to all functionality

### **Priority 2 (Next Week):**
1. **Token usage & cost tracking** - Critical for production monitoring
2. **Checkpointing functionality** - Important for resilience
3. **Error handling scenarios** - Critical for stability

### **Priority 3 (Following Week):**
1. **Batch processing workflows** - Important for scale
2. **Performance and edge cases** - Optimize and harden

## üõ† **Implementation Strategy**

### **Step 1: Fix Existing Tests (Week 1)**
```python
# Update skipped tests to work with current implementation
# Focus on:
# - Remove account_key requirements where appropriate
# - Update state handling to use new GraphState
# - Fix token usage collection to use new mechanism
# - Update batch processing to use new flow
```

### **Step 2: Add Critical New Tests (Week 1-2)**
```python
# Focus on recent changes and core functionality
# Priority areas:
# - Routing logic enhancements (recent commits)
# - State management (foundation for everything)
# - Basic prediction workflow (core functionality)
```

### **Step 3: Expand Coverage (Week 2-3)**
```python
# Add comprehensive test suites for:
# - Token usage and cost calculation
# - Checkpointing and persistence
# - Error handling and edge cases
```

### **Step 4: Integration Tests (Week 3-4)**
```python
# End-to-end workflow tests
# Performance tests
# Complex scenario tests
```

## üéØ **Specific Implementation Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Create `test_langgraph_score_routing_enhanced.py`**
   - Test the recent routing enhancements
   - Protect against regressions in critical logic

2. **Create `test_langgraph_score_state_management.py`**
   - Test GraphState creation and management
   - Test state merging and aliasing

3. **Fix existing `LangGraphScore_test.py`**
   - Un-skip tests and update for current implementation
   - Focus on basic functionality first

4. **Create `test_langgraph_score_prediction_workflow.py`**
   - Test the core predict() method thoroughly
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases

### **Testing Patterns:**
- **Use mocks extensively** - Avoid complex LLM dependencies
- **Test logic, not infrastructure** - Focus on workflow construction
- **Test error scenarios** - Critical for production stability
- **Use fixtures for common setups** - Reduce test duplication

## üèÜ **Success Metrics**

**Target Outcomes:**
- **65% coverage** for LangGraphScore (up from 3%)
- **0 skipped tests** (down from 16)
- **Recent changes protected** (routing, state management)
- **Production stability** (error handling, cost tracking)
- **Regression prevention** (comprehensive test suite)

---

**üö® BOTTOM LINE: LangGraphScore is super critical code with massive test coverage gaps. The 16 skipped tests represent a significant technical debt that needs immediate attention. Focus on the recent routing changes and core state management first, then expand systematically.**
