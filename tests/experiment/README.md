# Multi-Agent ReAct Loop Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test coverage for the multi-agent ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop system that powers our experiment hypothesis generation.

## System Architecture Story

Our multi-agent system follows the **ReAct paradigm** with clear separation of concerns:

### Manager Agent (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Follows Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and guides conversation flow
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Analyzes current state and progress
  - Provides contextual guidance to worker agent
  - Manages phase transitions (exploration → synthesis → hypothesis generation)
  - Evaluates worker actions and determines next steps
  - Enforces completion criteria and safety limits

### Worker Agent (Coding Assistant)  
- **Role**: Executes specific tool calls based on manager guidance
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Interprets manager guidance to select appropriate tools
  - Executes tools within scoped constraints
  - Reports results back to manager
  - Handles tool failures gracefully
  - Adapts approach based on tool results

### ReAct Loop Flow
```
Manager Reasons → Worker Acts → Manager Evaluates → Manager Reasons → ...
```

1. **Manager Reasons**: Analyzes state, determines next action needed per SOP
2. **Worker Acts**: Executes specific tools based on manager's reasoning
3. **Manager Evaluates**: Assesses results, determines if goals achieved
4. **Cycle Repeats**: Until completion criteria met or safety limits reached

## Key Testing Principles

### 1. **Story-Driven Testing**
Tests tell coherent stories about how the system works:
- Clear narrative structure (setup → action → validation)
- Real-world scenario simulation
- User-understandable behavior verification

### 2. **Component Isolation**
Each agent and system component is tested independently:
- Manager agent reasoning and guidance
- Worker agent tool execution and reporting
- State management and transitions
- Tool scoping and security

### 3. **Integration Validation**
Components are tested working together:
- Complete ReAct loop cycles
- Multi-phase conversation flows
- Cross-component communication

### 4. **Deterministic Behavior**
Tests use controlled mocks and stubs:
- Predictable tool responses
- Scripted conversation flows
- Reproducible test outcomes

### 5. **Safety and Robustness**
Error conditions and edge cases are covered:
- Tool failure handling
- Scoping violation responses
- Safety limit enforcement
- Graceful degradation
