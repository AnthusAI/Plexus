# Plexus MCP System Overview

The Plexus MCP (Multi-Agent Cooperative Protocol) system enables AI agents and tools to interact with Plexus functionality through a standardized protocol. This document provides an overview of the system architecture and key components.

## Core Components

### Server Implementation
- **Main Server**: [MCP/plexus_fastmcp_server.py](mdc:Plexus-2/Plexus-2/Plexus-2/MCP/plexus_fastmcp_server.py) - Core server implementation using the `fastmcp` library
- **Legacy Compatibility**: [MCP/plexus_mcp_server.py](mdc:Plexus-2/Plexus-2/Plexus-2/MCP/plexus_mcp_server.py) - Compatibility wrapper that forwards to the FastMCP server for existing configurations
- **Wrapper Script**: [MCP/plexus_fastmcp_wrapper.py](mdc:Plexus-2/Plexus-2/Plexus-2/MCP/plexus_fastmcp_wrapper.py) - Handles proper stdout/stderr separation and environment setup

### Key Features
1. **Protocol Communication**

### Production Testing Success ✅

**First Successful Mutation Operation** (January 2025):
- **Scorecard**: "CS3 - Audigy TPA" 
- **Score**: "Good Call"
- **Operation**: Updated score configuration via `update_plexus_score_configuration`
- **Changes**: Added note "Claude.app was here (via MCP) for Ryan" to YAML configuration
- **Result**: Successfully created new score version and updated champion version
- **Version Note**: "Updated via Claude.app MCP for Ryan"
- **Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING** in Claude.app MCP integration

This represents a major milestone as the first working mutation operation in the Plexus MCP server, enabling AI agents to not just read but also modify Plexus configurations through natural language interactions.

### Known Issues & Upcoming Fixes
- **Task Type Filtering**: The `get_latest_plexus_task` function with evaluation type filtering needs troubleshooting - task type matching may not work correctly for evaluation tasks
- **Case Sensitivity**: Task type filtering may be case-sensitive and not handle variations in task type naming

## Implementation Details

### Server Architecture
- Built on `fastmcp` library for improved performance and easier development
- Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- Supports Python 3.11+ (recommended for FastMCP)
- ✅ **Supports both read and write operations** (queries and mutations)
- ✅ **Production-tested** with real scorecard configuration updates

### Tool Implementation Pattern
1. Define tool schema with input/output specifications using FastMCP decorators
2. Implement handler function with error handling
3. Register tool with server using `@mcp.tool()` decorators
4. Add read-only annotation where appropriate (skip for mutation tools)
5. **Mutation Tools** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**: Follow GraphQL mutation patterns for updating data
   - Use `CreateScoreVersion` and `UpdateScore` mutations for configuration updates
   - Implement proper YAML validation and error handling
   - Return detailed results including new version IDs and dashboard URLs
   - **Successfully tested** with production scorecard updates

### Error Handling
- All errors are captured and returned as structured responses
- Detailed logging to stderr for debugging
- Clean error messages for client consumption

## Configuration

### Claude Code Installation
To install the Plexus MCP server for use with Claude Code for all projects for the current user, use the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user plexus-mcp-service: /opt/anaconda3/envs/py311/bin/python /Users/username/Projects/MCP/plexus_fastmcp_wrapper.py
```

Replace `/Users/username/Projects/Plexus` with the actual path to your Plexus project directory.

This command will:
1. Add the MCP server to Claude Code's configuration
2. Set the correct transport mode (`stdio`) 
3. Configure the necessary environment variables
4. Enable access to all Plexus tools within Claude Code conversations

### Client Setup (Other MCP Clients)
To use with other MCP clients (e.g., Cursor), configure `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plexus-mcp-service": {
      "command": "/path/to/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/plexus_fastmcp_wrapper.py",
        "--transport", "stdio",
        "--env-file", "/path/to/env/dir/.env",
        "--target-cwd", "/path/to/project/"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/plexus"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Ensure the paths point to the correct Plexus project directory you want to use. The MCP server will import Plexus modules from the `PYTHONPATH` and current working directory, so make sure these point to the development version you're working with, not an unrelated installed package.

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Plexus installation with dashboard access
- Valid `.env` file with API credentials
- `python-dotenv` package (recommended)

#### Required Environment Variables
- `PLEXUS_API_URL`: The AppSync API endpoint URL
- `PLEXUS_API_KEY`: The API key for authentication
- `PLEXUS_DASHBOARD_URL`: The base URL of the Plexus dashboard (for generating deep links)

#### Optional Environment Variables
- `PLEXUS_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Default account key to use when not specified
- `MCP_DEBUG`: Set to "true" to enable debug logging
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Best Practices
1. Always use the wrapper script to launch the server
2. Keep stdout clean for protocol messages
3. Use stderr for all logging and debugging
4. Implement proper error handling in tool functions
5. Add read-only annotation for safe tools
6. Document tool schemas clearly

### Development Environment Considerations
- **Multiple Plexus Installations**: Development workstations often have multiple Plexus project clones and installations
- **Python Path Priority**: The MCP server imports Plexus modules from the current working directory first, then falls back to installed packages
- **CLI vs MCP Imports**: Be careful about which client creation functions to import:
  - ✅ Use `plexus.cli.client_utils.create_client()` - properly sets up account context from environment variables
  - ❌ Avoid `plexus.cli.ScorecardCommands.create_client()` - doesn't configure account context
- **Testing Approach**: When testing MCP functionality, run from the project directory you want to test against
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env` file is in the correct project directory and loaded properly

## Troubleshooting
- Check stderr for detailed error messages
- Verify environment variables are loaded
- Ensure Python version is 3.11+
- Confirm proper stdout/stderr separation
- Validate tool schemas and implementations

### Common Issues
- **Account Resolution Errors**: If you see `Variable 'key' has coerced Null value for NonNull type 'String!'`, check:
  - `PLEXUS_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable is set
  - Using `client_utils.create_client()` instead of `ScorecardCommands.create_client()`
  - `.env` file is in the correct directory and loaded
- **Import Errors**: If MCP tools fail to import Plexus modules, verify:
  - Running from the correct project directory
  - Python path includes the current project
  - Not accidentally importing from a different Plexus installation
- **Wrong Plexus Version**: If CLI behavior doesn't match expectations:
  - Check `which plexus` to see which installation is being used
  - Use `python -m plexus.cli.CommandLineInterface` to run from current directory
  - Verify project directory has the expected CLI commands available
- **GraphQL Field Errors**: If you see `Cannot query field 'data' on type 'Item'`:
  - This indicates an outdated Item model is being used
  - Restart the MCP server to ensure latest code is loaded
  - Check that the correct `plexus_fastmcp_server.py` is being executed
  - Verify that test files are using the current Item model structure
- **Task Type Filtering Issues**: If `get_latest_plexus_task` with task type filtering doesn't work:
  - Task type values may not match expected strings (case sensitivity)
  - Task type field might contain different values than expected
  - Check actual task data with `get_latest_plexus_task()` (no filter) to see available task types
  - Verify that task type filtering logic matches the actual data structure

## Logging
- MCP logs are stored in `~/Library/Logs/Claude`
- You can monitor logs in real-time using `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log`
- Logs contain detailed information about protocol communication and tool execution
- Useful for debugging connection issues and tool failures
