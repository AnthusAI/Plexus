# Plexus FeedbackAnalysisEvaluation Enhancement Plan

**Status Legend:**
*   â¬œ Not Started / To Do
*   ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
*   âœ… Completed

## Introduction

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the FeedbackAnalysisEvaluation component within the Plexus platform's reporting system. The enhancements will focus on improving the display of metrics through gauges, optimizing responsive layouts, implementing collapsible/expandable views for detailed information, and adding support for downloading log files and drilling into individual feedback analysis details.

## Core Requirements - Updated

The enhanced FeedbackAnalysisEvaluation component needs to:

1. âœ… Display two key gauges:
   - Agreement (AC1)
   - Accuracy
   - ~~Precision~~ (Removed per requirements update)
   - ~~Recall~~ (Removed per requirements update)

2. âœ… Implement responsive variations to display effectively across different screen widths

3. âœ… In collapsed mode:
   - Show the score name
   - Show Items count and Agreements count
   - Display both gauges (Agreement and Accuracy)
   - Show any warnings if present

4. âœ… In expanded mode:
   - Display class distribution visualization
   - Display predicted class distribution
   - Display confusion matrix
   - Display EvaluationListAccuracyBar for agreement accuracy

5. Provide access to logs:
   - Add UI for downloading log files stored in S3 via Amplify Gen2's storage mechanism
   - Display log file availability and controls

6. Support detailed analysis drilling:
   - Implement mechanism to load and parse JSON attachment files from S3
   - Create UI for exploring individual comparison details stored in these JSON files
   - Handle the asynchronous loading of this data which is not directly available from the API

## Progress Summary

We have successfully implemented multiple phases of the enhancement:

âœ… **Flat Design Implementation**:
- Removed all borders, shadows, and depth-creating elements
- Implemented a clean, flat design with a beachy card background
- Ensured consistency with Plexus design language

âœ… **Component Structure and Layout**:
- Created a clean layout with collapsible/expandable functionality
- Implemented proper spacing and organization of elements
- Added responsive sizing for different screen widths

âœ… **Gauge Implementation**:
- Implemented two gauges (Agreement and Accuracy) in the collapsed view
- Added proper handling for missing data
- Used appropriate styling and size for gauges

âœ… **Metadata Display**:
- Added Items and Agreements counts in the collapsed view
- Used positive language ("Agreements" instead of "Mismatches")
- Implemented clean horizontal layout

âœ… **Warning System**:
- Added warning display with icon and message
- Ensured warnings are always visible in collapsed mode
- Used appropriate styling for warning alerts

âœ… **Expanded View**:
- Implemented visualizations (class distribution, predicted distribution, confusion matrix)
- Added EvaluationListAccuracyBar for agreement accuracy
- Created clean separation between collapsed and expanded views
