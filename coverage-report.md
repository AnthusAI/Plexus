### Test Files Found
- 13 test suites total
- 99 tests passed
- Key test files:
  - `CTASection.test.tsx`
  - `hydration.test.tsx` 
  - `hierarchicalAggregator.test.ts`
  - `generalizedMetricsAggregator.test.ts`
  - `MetricsGauges.test.tsx`
  - `subscriptions.test.ts`
  - `amplify-api.test.ts`
  - `transformers.test.ts`

## Python Core Coverage

**Status:** Unable to execute coverage tests due to dependency issues

### Challenges Encountered
- Missing dependencies (mlflow, click, etc.) preventing test execution
- Externally managed Python environment preventing package installation
- Circular import issues in `plexus/__init__.py`

### Codebase Analysis
- **Total Python files:** 250 files
- **Total lines of code:** 70,641 lines
- **Test files within plexus module:** 59 files (~15,837 lines)
- **Test files in tests directory:** 4 files (~903 lines)

### Test Coverage Structure
#### Within Module Tests (`plexus/`)
- Score-related tests: 
  - `ScoreData_test.py`
  - `OpenAI_test.py`
  - `BaseNode_test.py`
  - `Classifier_test.py`
  - `Extractor_test.py`
  - `FuzzyMatchExtractor_test.py`
  - `LogicalNode_test.py`
  - `MultiClassClassifier_test.py`
  - `YesOrNoClassifier_test.py`
  - `AgenticValidator_test.py`
- Plus 49 additional test files covering various components

#### External Tests (`tests/`)
- `test_task_commands.py`
- `test_task_targeting.py` 
- `test_langgraph_edge_configuration.py`
- `test_scorecard_integration.py`

### Estimated Test Coverage
Based on file analysis:
- **Test files ratio:** 59 test files out of 250 total files (~24%)
- **Test code ratio:** 15,837 test lines out of 70,641 total lines (~22%)

## Recommendations

### TypeScript/Dashboard
1. **Priority:** Improve hooks coverage (currently 2%) - critical for React functionality
2. **Medium Priority:** 
   - Increase component/ui coverage from 44% to >60%
   - Improve utils coverage from 45% to >60%
   - Add more tests for app/evaluations pages
3. **Maintain:** Keep high coverage areas (landing pages, contexts, types) well-tested

### Python/Core
1. **Immediate:** Resolve dependency management issues
   - Set up proper virtual environment or Docker container
   - Install required dependencies (mlflow, click, etc.)
   - Fix circular import issues
2. **Coverage Goals:**
   - Target 70%+ coverage for critical CLI components
   - Ensure all score/evaluation modules have comprehensive tests
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints

### Overall Project
1. **CI/CD Integration:** Set up automated coverage reporting in build pipeline
2. **Coverage Targets:** 
   - TypeScript: Aim for 70% overall coverage
   - Python: Aim for 65% overall coverage
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Implement coverage regression detection

## Current Status Summary

| Component | Coverage Status | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| TypeScript Dashboard | ‚úÖ 48% measured | üîß Improve hooks & utils |
| Python Core | ‚ùå Cannot measure | üö® Fix dependencies first |
| Total Project | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial visibility | üîß Complete setup |

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Resolve Python dependency issues and get baseline coverage measurement
2. **Week 2:** Focus on improving TypeScript hooks coverage (critical gap)
3. **Week 3:** Implement automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
4. **Ongoing:** Regular coverage monitoring and incremental improvements
