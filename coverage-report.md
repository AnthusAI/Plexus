  - ✅ langchain, transformers, torch
  - ✅ All testing infrastructure (pytest, coverage)

### Test Architecture Analysis
- **Total Tests:** 557 tests across the codebase
- **Test Distribution:**
  - CLI tests: Comprehensive coverage of command interfaces
  - Core functionality: Node classes, data processing
  - Integration tests: End-to-end scorecard workflows
  - API models: Dashboard integration testing

## Recommendations

### TypeScript/Dashboard
1. **Priority:** Improve hooks coverage (currently 2%) - critical for React functionality
2. **Medium Priority:** 
   - Increase component/ui coverage from 44% to >60%
   - Improve utils coverage from 45% to >60%
   - Add more tests for app/evaluations pages
3. **Maintain:** Keep high coverage areas (landing pages, contexts, types) well-tested

### Python/Core
1. **Immediate Wins (37% → 50%+):**
   - **ML Components:** Focus on `Evaluation.py` (currently 9%) - most impactful for coverage
   - **Analysis modules:** Improve `topics/analyzer.py` and `topics/transformer.py` (currently 10-12%)
   - **CLI Commands:** Expand `BatchCommands.py` tests (currently 29%)
2. **Medium-term Goals (50% → 65%+):**
   - **Complex workflows:** Add integration tests for scorecard end-to-end flows
   - **Error handling:** Test failure scenarios and edge cases
   - **Data processing:** Increase coverage of processor and storage modules
3. **Architecture:** Environment fully functional - focus on test expansion, not setup

### Overall Project
1. **CI/CD Integration:** Set up automated coverage reporting in build pipeline
2. **Coverage Targets:** 
   - TypeScript: Aim for 70% overall coverage
   - Python: Aim for 65% overall coverage
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Implement coverage regression detection

## Current Status Summary

| Component | Coverage Status | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| TypeScript Dashboard | ✅ 48% measured | 🔧 Improve hooks & utils |
| Python Core | ✅ 37% measured | � Focus on ML components |
| Total Project | ⚠️ Partial visibility | � Fix Python version incompatibility |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Expand Python ML component tests (focus on `Evaluation.py` for biggest impact)
2. **Week 1:** Increase TypeScript hooks coverage from 2% to >50%
3. **Week 2:** Add integration tests for end-to-end scorecard workflows
4. **Week 3:** Implement automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
5. **Ongoing:** Target 65% Python coverage and 60% TypeScript coverage
