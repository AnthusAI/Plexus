## Comment Guidelines
- Prefer descriptive names over explanatory line comments.
- Remove line-level comments that simply restate the code or appear to be AI-generated artifacts.
- Retain high level block comments and section headers (lines of `#` used to separate sections).
- Keep and improve docstrings where helpful, but avoid excessive inline comments.

## Development Guidelines
- After making changes, run `pytest -q` from the repository root.
