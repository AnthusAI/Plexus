class: "BeamSearch"

value: |
  -- Extract accuracy score from experiment node's structured data
  local score = experiment_node.value.accuracy or 0
  -- Apply cost penalty to balance performance vs efficiency  
  local penalty = (experiment_node.value.cost or 0) * 0.1
  -- Return single scalar value (higher is better)
  return score - penalty

exploration: |
  You are helping optimize an AI system through beam search experimentation.
  
  You have access to previous experiment results including their configurations, 
  performance metrics, and computed values. Your job is to suggest new experiment 
  variations that might improve performance.
  
  Based on the results so far, propose specific changes to try next. Focus on 
  modifications that could address weaknesses or build on promising directions.
  
  Generate concrete, actionable suggestions for the next experiment iteration.
