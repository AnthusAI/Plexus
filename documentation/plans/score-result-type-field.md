## Background & Context

Currently, the Plexus system creates ScoreResult records through two main processes:
1. **Predictions** - When using the predict functionality to score items
2. **Evaluations** - When running evaluations to test model performance

Both processes create ScoreResult records and properly associate them with Items through the `itemId` foreign key field. However, there's currently no way to distinguish between score results created by predictions vs evaluations in the data model or dashboard.

## Problem Statement

Users need to be able to:
- Distinguish between prediction and evaluation score results in the database
- View separate counts and metrics for predictions vs evaluations in the dashboard
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing score results

## Solution Overview

Add a `type` field to the ScoreResult model to categorize score results by their creation method, and enhance the dashboard to show breakdowns by type.

## Key Files & Components

- Implement data fetching for feedback-specific metrics
- Update component to use real data instead of mock data
- Consider if feedback should use a different type value or separate data source
- **Files:** `dashboard/components/FeedbackItemsGauges.tsx`

### 📋 Phase 6: Final Validation & Performance Testing

#### 🧪 Step 6.1: End-to-end testing with real data
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Details:**
- Test complete evaluation workflow with type field and dashboard display
- Test complete prediction workflow with type field and dashboard display
- Verify dashboard displays correct metrics and breakdowns by type
- Validate backward compatibility with existing score results
- Test drawer functionality with real data across all three components

#### 🧪 Step 6.2: Performance validation
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**Details:**
- Verify filtering performance is acceptable (vs GSI approach)
- Test dashboard responsiveness with type-based filtering
- Monitor for any performance regressions
- Validate that three simultaneous data fetches don't impact performance
- Consider caching strategies if needed

## Technical Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- Type field should be optional to support existing score results without type
- Dashboard should handle null/empty type values gracefully
- Aggregation should treat null type as "both" or "unknown"

### Indexing Strategy
- Initially, we'll use filtering rather than creating new GSIs
- Future consideration: Evaluate if type-based GSI is needed for performance
- Current GSIs are already complex, so filtering approach is preferred initially

### Type Values
- `"prediction"` - Score results created through prediction functionality
- `"evaluation"` - Score results created through evaluation processes
- `null`/empty - Existing score results or unknown type (treated as "both")

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding more granular types (e.g., "batch_prediction", "manual_evaluation")
- Evaluate need for type-based GSI if filtering performance becomes an issue
- Add type-based filtering to other dashboard components and reports

## Status Legend

3. All prediction score results are created with `type: "prediction"`
4. Dashboard shows total counts by default
5. Dashboard popup shows breakdown by prediction vs evaluation
6. Existing functionality remains unaffected
7. Performance impact is minimal (filtering vs new GSI)
