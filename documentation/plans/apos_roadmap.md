# Automated Prompt Optimization System (APOS) Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup [Complete]
- [x] Create `OptimizationState` class to track optimization progress
- [x] Create `IterationResult` class to store per-iteration data
- [x] Create `MismatchAnalysis` class for storing analysis results
- [x] Create `PromptChange` class to track prompt modifications
- [x] Set up basic logging and configuration system
- [x] Implement result persistence layer
- [x] Create evaluation history tracking

## Phase 2: Basic Analysis Pipeline [Complete]
- [x] Extend `AccuracyEvaluation` to store detailed mismatch data
- [x] Implement initial `PromptAnalyzer` for basic analysis
- [x] Create `PromptOptimizer` for generating prompt improvements
- [x] Add methods to compare results between iterations
- [x] Basic integration with evaluation system

## Phase 3: Enhanced Analysis Pipeline [In Progress]

### 3.1 Individual Mismatch Analysis [Complete]
- [x] Create dedicated analyzer for individual mismatches
- [x] Design prompt template for single-mismatch analysis
- [x] Implement core error analysis (what went wrong and why)
- [x] Store raw analysis results

### 3.2 Analysis Summarization [Complete]
- [x] Design LLM prompts for analyzing mismatch patterns
- [x] Implement recursive summarization of mismatch analyses
- [x] Generate improvement recommendations

### 3.3 Optimization Integration [Complete]
- [x] Update optimizer to use analysis summaries
- [x] Improve prompt modification logic
- [x] Add validation of suggested changes
- [x] Test optimization with new analysis pipeline

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation [In Progress]
- [ ] Create test suite for new analysis pipeline
- [ ] Validate analysis quality
- [x] Test with real evaluation data
- [ ] Measure analysis and optimization performance
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete system

## Success Criteria
- Individual mismatch analyses clearly identify what went wrong
- LLM summarization identifies patterns and suggests improvements
- Optimizer generates effective prompt improvements
- System shows consistent accuracy improvements
- Clear tracking of analysis and optimization progress

## Current Status
- Phase: 4 - Testing and Validation
- Next Step: Measure analysis and optimization performance
- Current Task: Running end-to-end tests with real data and tracking performance metrics
