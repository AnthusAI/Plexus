# Public Evaluation Route

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a public evaluation route at `/evaluations/[ID]`. This route will allow direct access to evaluation results via a public URL, with the evaluation ID as the identifier.

## Current Status
✓ Initial Analysis Complete:
- Confirmed all necessary components exist
- Verified no schema changes needed
- Confirmed public access already configured in schema
- Identified all required data transformations

✓ Route Implementation Complete:
- Created route files:
  - `app/evaluations/[id]/page.tsx` - Main page component
  - `app/evaluations/[id]/layout.tsx` - Layout component
- Implemented data fetching using Amplify client
- Implemented UI with:
  - Full-width container layout
  - EvaluationTask in detail mode
  - Loading spinner
  - Error states
  - Footer integration

✓ Unit Tests Complete:
- Created test suite in `app/evaluations/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- Implemented tests for:
  - Route component rendering
  - Data fetching
  - Error handling
  - Loading states
  - Component mocking

✓ Integration Tests Complete:
- Created Cypress test suite in `cypress/e2e/public-evaluation.cy.ts`
- Implemented end-to-end tests for:
  - Successful evaluation loading
  - Error handling (404, 500)
  - Responsive design across devices
  - API integration
  - Component interactions

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Components (All Existing)
- `EvaluationTask` component for displaying evaluation details
- Public API key authorization in Amplify schema
- Footer component from landing pages
- Data transformation utilities
- Evaluation model with all necessary relationships

### Route Structure
- Path: `/evaluations/[ID]`
- Type: Public route (no authentication required)
- Layout: Full-width with footer

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Route Implementation ✓
1. Create route files: ✓
   - `app/evaluations/[id]/page.tsx` - Main page component
   - `app/evaluations/[id]/layout.tsx` - Layout component

2. Implement data fetching: ✓
   - Use Amplify's generated client
   - Fetch evaluation by ID
   - Transform data using existing utilities
   - Handle loading and error states

3. Implement UI: ✓
   - Full-width container layout
   - EvaluationTask in detail mode
   - Loading spinner
   - Error states
   - Footer integration

### Phase 2: Testing
1. Unit Tests: ✓
   - Route component rendering
   - Data fetching
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

2. Integration Tests: ✓
   - End-to-end route testing
   - Public access verification
   - Data transformation validation
   - Responsive design testing

3. Manual Testing:
   - Various evaluation states
   - Different screen sizes
   - Error scenarios
   - Loading behavior

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Client requests `/evaluations/[ID]`
2. Page component fetches evaluation using public API client
3. Data is transformed using existing utilities
4. Rendered using `EvaluationTask` component

### Error Handling
- Not Found (404)
- Fetch Failures
- Data Transformation Errors
- Invalid Evaluation States

## Notes
Implementation was straightforward as all necessary components and infrastructure existed:
- No schema changes required
- Public access already configured
- All UI components available
- Data transformation utilities in place

## Next Steps
1. ✓ Create route files
2. ✓ Implement page component
3. ✓ Add unit tests
4. ✓ Add integration tests
5. Manual testing and verification

## Future Considerations
- Analytics tracking for public views
- Rate limiting if needed
- Caching strategy if high traffic expected
- SEO optimization if needed
