# MCP Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into Plexus. MCP will allow us to expose Plexus functionality to AI assistants in a standardized way, enabling better integration with LLM-powered tools.

## Goals

1. Enable AI assistants to interact with Plexus through a standardized protocol
2. Expose Plexus resources and tools in a secure, controlled manner
3. Start with simple, verifiable implementations and gradually expand functionality
4. Provide a foundation for future AI-powered automation and integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Server Infrastructure

1. Create basic MCP server structure:
   ```
   plexus/mcp/
     __init__.py
     server.py      # Core MCP server implementation
     tools.py       # Tool definitions
     resources.py   # Resource definitions
   ```

2. Implement minimal server setup:
   - Basic server configuration
   - Connection handling
   - Health check endpoint
   - Integration with existing Plexus logging

3. Create server startup command:
   - Add `plexus mcp serve` command
   - Configuration via environment variables
   - Basic security settings

### Phase 2: Demo Task Tool

1. Implement demo task tool:
   - Create tool for dispatching demo tasks
   - Map existing demo task parameters to MCP tool schema
   - Handle task creation through existing API
   - Return task ID and initial status

2. Add progress tracking:
   - Integrate with existing task progress system
   - Map progress updates to MCP protocol
   - Enable real-time progress monitoring

3. Implement error handling:
   - Proper error reporting through MCP
   - Task failure scenarios
   - Cancellation support

### Phase 3: Task Management Resources

1. Add task listing resource:
   - Expose recent tasks as MCP resource
   - Include filtering capabilities
   - Real-time updates for task status changes

2. Implement task detail resource:
   - Detailed task information
   - Progress history
   - Related metadata

### Phase 4: Evaluation System Integration

1. Add evaluation listing resource:
   - Recent evaluations
   - Filtering by status, type, etc.
   - Pagination support

2. Implement evaluation tools:
   - Create new evaluations
   - Check evaluation status
   - Retrieve results

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

1. Add authentication and authorization:
   - Secure access to resources and tools
   - Role-based permissions
   - API key management

2. Implement subscription capabilities:
   - Real-time updates for resources
   - WebSocket support
   - Event filtering

3. Add advanced task management:
   - Task queuing and prioritization
   - Resource allocation
   - Batch operations

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests:
   - Individual tool implementations
   - Resource handlers
   - Protocol compliance

2. Integration Tests:
   - End-to-end tool execution
   - Resource data consistency
   - Progress tracking accuracy

3. Performance Tests:
   - Connection handling
   - Concurrent operations
   - Resource update propagation

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication:
   - API key validation
   - Token-based access
   - Rate limiting

2. Authorization:
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Tool execution restrictions
   - Audit logging

3. Data Protection:
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Resource isolation
   - Secure communication

## Future Expansion

1. Additional Resources:
   - Model management
   - Training data access
   - System metrics

2. Enhanced Tools:
   - Automated evaluation
   - Model deployment
   - Data processing

3. Integration Points:
   - IDE plugins
   - CI/CD systems
   - External AI services

## Success Metrics

1. Functionality:
   - Successful tool execution
   - Accurate resource representation
   - Reliable progress tracking

2. Performance:
   - Response times
   - Update latency
   - Resource utilization

3. Adoption:
   - Tool usage metrics
   - Integration examples
   - User feedback
