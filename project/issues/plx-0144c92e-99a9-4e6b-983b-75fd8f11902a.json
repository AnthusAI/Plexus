  "description": "## Open Redirect\n\n**Severity:** medium\n**Package:** urllib3@2.0.7\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/requirements.txt`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 6.0  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 514/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2025-50181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-50181)\n\n**Fix:** Pin `urllib3` to version 2.5.0 or later.\n\n### Details\n## Overview\n[urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/) is a HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling, file post, and more.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect due to the `retries` parameter being ignored during `PoolManager` instantiation. An attacker can access unintended resources or endpoints by leveraging automatic redirects when the application expects redirects to be disabled at the connection pool level.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n`requests` and `botocore` users are not affected.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by disabling redirects at the `request()` level instead of the `PoolManager()` level.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `urllib3` to version 2.5.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-URLLIB3-10390194)",
