  "description": "## CVE-2025-7709\n\n**Severity:** low\n**Package:** sqlite3/libsqlite3-0@3.46.1-7\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/Dockerfile`\n\n**Snyk Priority Score:** 150/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2025-7709](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7709)\n\n**Fix:** No automatic fix available. Review manually.\n\n### Details\n## NVD Description\n**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply only to the upstream `sqlite3` package and not the `sqlite3` package as distributed by `Debian`._\n_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:13` relevant fixed versions and status._\n\nAn integer overflow exists in the  FTS5 https://sqlite.org/fts5.html  extension. It occurs when the size of an array of tombstone pointers is calculated and truncated into a 32-bit integer. A pointer to partially controlled data can then be written out of bounds.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:13` `sqlite3`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7709)\n- [https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v2c8-vqqp-hv3g](https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-v2c8-vqqp-hv3g)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/06/2](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/06/2)\n- [http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/18/10](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/18/10)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN13-SQLITE3-12549228)",
