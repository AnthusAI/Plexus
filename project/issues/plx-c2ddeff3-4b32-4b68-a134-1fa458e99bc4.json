  "description": "## Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type\n\n**Severity:** medium\n**Package:** on-headers@1.0.2\n**File:** `dashboard/package.json`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 4.6  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 230/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2025-7339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7339)\n\n**Fix:** Upgrade `on-headers` to version 1.1.0 or later.\n\n### Details\n## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type via the `response.writeHead` function. An attacker can manipulate HTTP response headers by passing an array to this function, potentially leading to unintended disclosure or modification of header information.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` instead of an array.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `on-headers` to version 1.1.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers/commit/c6e384908c9c6127d18831d16ab0bd96e1231867)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan/issues/315)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers/issues/15)\n- [OpenJS Advisories](https://cna.openjsf.org/security-advisories.html)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ONHEADERS-10773729)",
