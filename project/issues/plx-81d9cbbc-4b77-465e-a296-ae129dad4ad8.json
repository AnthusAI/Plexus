  "description": "## Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n\n**Severity:** high\n**Package:** cryptography@45.0.7\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/requirements.txt`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 8.9  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 731/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2026-26007](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-26007)\n\n**Fix:** Pin `cryptography` to version 46.0.5 or later.\n\n### Details\n## Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity in public key functions `public_key_from_numbers`, `EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key`, `load_der_public_key`, and `load_pem_public_key`, which may reveal bits from a private key when provided with a malicious public key as input. When the application is using `sect*` binary curves for verification - which is a rare use case - these functions do not verify that the provided point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup of the curve. An attacker can thus expose partial private keys or forge signatures.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `cryptography` to version 46.0.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/0eebb9dbb6343d9bc1d91e5a2482ed4e054a6d8c)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/releases/tag/46.0.5)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-CRYPTOGRAPHY-15263096)",
