  "description": "## Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value\n\n**Severity:** low\n**Package:** systemd/libudev1@257.9-1~deb13u1\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/Dockerfile`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 5.3  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 150/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2023-31439](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31439)\n\n**Fix:** No automatic fix available. Review manually.\n\n### Details\n## NVD Description\n**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply only to the upstream `systemd` package and not the `systemd` package as distributed by `Debian`._\n_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:13` relevant fixed versions and status._\n\nAn issue was discovered in systemd 253. An attacker can modify the contents of past events in a sealed log file and then adjust the file such that checking the integrity shows no error, despite modifications. NOTE: the vendor reportedly sent &#34;a reply denying that any of the finding was a security vulnerability.&#34;\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:13` `systemd`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31439](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31439)\n- [https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald](https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald)\n- [https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf](https://github.com/kastel-security/Journald/blob/main/journald-publication.pdf)\n- [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/28885](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/28885)\n- [https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN13-SYSTEMD-5733389)",
