  "description": "## Access Restriction Bypass\n\n**Severity:** low\n**Package:** shadow/passwd@1:4.17.4-2\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/Dockerfile`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 6.2  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 150/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2007-5686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-5686)\n\n**Fix:** No automatic fix available. Review manually.\n\n### Details\n## NVD Description\n**_Note:_** _Versions mentioned in the description apply only to the upstream `shadow` package and not the `shadow` package as distributed by `Debian`._\n_See `How to fix?` for `Debian:13` relevant fixed versions and status._\n\ninitscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the /var/log/btmp file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information regarding authentication attempts.  NOTE: because sshd detects the insecure permissions and does not log certain events, this also prevents sshd from logging failed authentication attempts by remote attackers.\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `Debian:13` `shadow`.\n## References\n- [https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5686](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5686)\n- [http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/482129/100/100/threaded](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/482129/100/100/threaded)\n- [http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/482857/100/0/threaded](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/482857/100/0/threaded)\n- [https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1825](https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1825)\n- [http://secunia.com/advisories/27215](http://secunia.com/advisories/27215)\n- [http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26048](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26048)\n- [http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3474](http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3474)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DEBIAN13-SHADOW-5695385)",
