  "description": "## NULL Pointer Dereference\n\n**Severity:** low\n**Package:** numpy@1.21.3\n**File:** `score-processor-lambda/requirements.txt`\n\n**CVSS Score:** 3.7  \n**Exploit Maturity:** proof-of-concept  \n**Snyk Priority Score:** 506/1000\n\n### CVEs\n- [CVE-2021-41495](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41495)\n\n**Fix:** Pin `numpy` to version 1.22.2 or later.\n\n### Details\n## Overview\n[numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is a fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to NULL Pointer Dereference due to missing return-value validation in the `PyArray_DescrNew` function, which may allow attackers to conduct Denial of Service attacks by repetitively creating and sort arrays.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This may likely only happen if application memory is already exhausted, as it requires the `newdescr` object of the `PyArray_DescrNew` to evaluate to `NULL`.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `numpy` to version 1.22.2 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19038)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20960)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.22.2)\n\n\n### Reference\n- [Snyk advisory](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-NUMPY-2321964)",
