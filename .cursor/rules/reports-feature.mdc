# Plexus Reports Feature

The Reports feature in Plexus provides a flexible and extensible system for generating, storing, and viewing various types of reports and analyses.

## Core Concepts

- **ReportConfiguration**: Defines the structure and parameters for a report using Markdown and Jinja2 templating. Acts as a template for generating reports.
- **Report**: A specific instance of a report generated from a configuration. Stores the rendered output (Markdown) and links to individual ReportBlock results.
- **ReportBlock (Database Model)**: Stores JSON output and logs generated by a Python ReportBlock component.
- **ReportBlock (Python Class)**: Reusable Python components that generate specific sections or data points for a report.
- **Task / TaskStage**: Standard mechanism for dispatching, monitoring, and tracking report generation progress.

## Key Files

### Backend (Python)
- `plexus/reports/blocks/base.py`: Base class for Python report block components
- `plexus/reports/blocks/score_info.py`: ScoreInfo block implementation
- `plexus/reports/service.py`: Core service logic for report generation
- `plexus/cli/commands/report/`: CLI commands for managing reports

### Frontend (Dashboard)
- `dashboard/app/lab/reports/`: Report management pages
- `dashboard/components/reports/`: Report components
- `dashboard/components/reports/blocks/`: Block-specific components
- `dashboard/components/reports/BlockRegistry.tsx`: Registry for block components
- `dashboard/components/reports/BlockRenderer.tsx`: Renderer for block components

## Example Report Configuration

```markdown
# Report Header

This is a sample configuration.

```block name="Score Info Block"
class: ScoreInfo
scorecard: example_scorecard
score: ExampleScore
```
```

## Current Development Focus

The current focus is on:
1. Feedback Analysis integration - Refactoring client-specific analysis into the Plexus platform
2. Implementing specialized block components for various analysis types
3. Frontend block rendering optimizations
