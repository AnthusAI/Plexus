## Current Status Update

Based on the latest verification script results, we've made significant progress with the API-based scorecard loading functionality. All tests now pass when run from the Plexus-2 repository, using the installed `plexus` CLI to run commands in the Call-Criteria-Python directory:

1. ✅ Accuracy command with scorecard name
2. ✅ Accuracy command with scorecard key 
3. ✅ Accuracy command with specific score
4. ✅ Distribution command
5. ✅ Accuracy command with YAML flag
6. ✅ Caching performance improvement
7. ✅ Invalid scorecard error handling

The main improvements include:
1. Successfully implemented `--dry-run` option to bypass database operations for testing
2. Created a verification script that properly tests the functionality from Call-Criteria-Python
3. Fixed module path issues by executing tests using the installed `plexus` CLI rather than direct Python imports
4. Ensured correct working directory management when running tests from Plexus-2 repository

The remaining steps are:
1. ✅ Complete Step 17D to address database dependencies in the accuracy command
2. ⬜ Complete Step 18 for end-to-end testing with dependencies
3. ⬜ Complete Step 19 for comprehensive performance testing
4. ⬜ Complete Step 20 for documentation updates

The core API loading functionality is now working correctly and showing performance improvements through caching. The next phase will focus on dependency resolution testing and further optimization.

## Cross-Repository Testing Approach

A key insight from this implementation is the proper approach for testing changes across the Plexus-2 and Call-Criteria-Python repositories:

1. **Development Installation:** Install the Plexus-2 package in development mode from the Plexus-2 repository root:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/Plexus-2
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **CLI-Based Testing:** When writing verification scripts that run from Plexus-2 but test functionality in Call-Criteria-Python:
   - Use the installed `plexus` CLI command rather than `python -m plexus`
   - Change working directory to Call-Criteria-Python before running commands
   - Execute via subprocess, capturing output for verification

3. **Directory Management:** Handle working directory changes properly:
   ```python
   # Store original directory
   original_dir = Path.cwd()
   
   # Change to client directory for testing
   os.chdir('/Users/ryan/projects/Call-Criteria-Python')
   
   try:
       # Run test commands
       result = subprocess.run(['plexus', 'evaluate', 'accuracy', ...])
   finally:
       # Always restore original directory
       os.chdir(original_dir)
   ```

This approach ensures clean separation between development in Plexus-2 and testing in the client environment while avoiding Python module path conflicts.

## Key Challenges Addressed

### Module Import Path Conflicts

The most significant challenge we encountered was Python module import path conflicts when testing across the two repositories:

**Issue:** When running commands from Call-Criteria-Python that referenced Plexus-2 code, we encountered errors like:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plexus.scores.core'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plexus.scores.LangGraphScore'
```

**Root Cause:** 
1. Python's import system was attempting to locate modules relative to the running script
2. When executing `python -m plexus` from Call-Criteria-Python, it was trying to use Plexus-2's module structure
3. However, the Call-Criteria-Python repository had a different internal structure for the plexus modules

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ Copying missing modules from Plexus-2 to Call-Criteria-Python (incorrect approach)
2. ❌ Modifying Python path variables in testing scripts
3. ✅ Using the installed `plexus` CLI command instead of Python module imports

**Final Solution:**
The key insight was that we should leverage the pip-installed development version of Plexus rather than trying to mix imports across repositories. By using the installed CLI and changing to the appropriate working directory, we avoided all module import conflicts while still testing the under-development features.

### Bypassing Database Dependencies for Testing

Another challenge was creating a way to test the API loading functionality without requiring database connectivity:

**Issue:** The `accuracy` command required database operations to create tasks, evaluations, and store results.

**Solution:** We implemented a `--dry-run` flag that:
1. Creates mock objects for database entities (tasks, accounts, scorecard records)
2. Skips all database query and update operations
3. Provides detailed logging about operations that would have occurred
4. Returns early from the command execution after loading the scorecard

This allowed us to verify the API loading functionality was working correctly without requiring a connected database environment, significantly simplifying testing.

## Implementation Checklist

- ⬜ **Step 18: End-to-end testing with dependencies**
  - What: Test evaluation with scores that have dependencies
  - Goal: Confirm dependency resolution works correctly
  - Verify: All dependencies are loaded and evaluation results are correct when tested from the `/Users/ryan/projects/Call-Criteria-Python` directory

- ⬜ **Step 19: Performance testing**
  - What: Test performance with and without caching
  - Goal: Confirm caching improves performance
  - Verify: Second runs are faster due to cache hits when running from the `/Users/ryan/projects/Call-Criteria-Python` directory

- ⬜ **Step 20: Documentation update**
  - What: Update command documentation with new options
  - Goal: Ensure users understand the new capabilities
  - Verify: Help text is clear and comprehensive when running commands from the `/Users/ryan/projects/Call-Criteria-Python` directory
